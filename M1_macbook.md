Based on the documentation provided, I can help with both of your questions about building Visual Studio Code for Mac M1 (ARM64) and testing changes without rebuilding each time.

## Building for Mac M1 (ARM64)

To build VS Code for Mac with an M1 chip (ARM64 architecture), you need to:

1. Ensure you have the prerequisites:
   - Git
   - Node.JS (version â‰¥20.x, ARM64 version)
   - Python
   - Xcode and Command Line Tools (run `xcode-select --install` to install them)

2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-github-account/vscode.git
   cd vscode
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Use the packaging command specific for macOS ARM64:
   ```bash
   npm run gulp vscode-darwin-arm64
   ```
   
   For a minified version, use:
   ```bash
   npm run gulp vscode-darwin-arm64-min
   ```

## Testing Changes Without Rebuilding

Yes, you can test changes without rebuilding every time! The document mentions two key features for this:

1. **Incremental builder**: After the initial build, run either:
   ```bash
   npm run watch
   ```
   Or press `Cmd+Shift+B` in VS Code.

   This will watch for file changes and compile them incrementally, giving you a fast, iterative coding experience.

2. **Reload Window**: You don't need to stop and restart VS Code after each change. You can just:
   - Execute "Reload Window" from the command palette
   - The document recommends assigning the keyboard shortcut `Cmd+R` to this command

The incremental builder will display a message that includes "Finished compilation" once the initial build is complete, and then it will automatically compile any changes you make.

To run your development version of VS Code on macOS, use:
```bash
./scripts/code.sh
```

This approach gives you real-time testing of your changes without needing to rebuild the entire application each time.

###Check this 2nd version
I understand you're trying to build VSCode for Apple Silicon (ARM64) but the build process isn't completing and no interface is opening. Let's fix this.

Before running the build command, we need to ensure all prerequisites are installed and the initial setup is done correctly. Here's what you should do:

1. First, make sure you have all the dependencies installed:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Then, you need to download the built-in extensions:
```bash
npm run download-builtin-extensions
```

3. Next, compile the source code:
```bash
npm run compile
```

4. After that, try running VSCode with:
```bash
npm run electron
```

If you specifically want to build for ARM64, you can try this sequence:

1. Clean the build:
```bash
npm run gulp clean-out-build
```

2. Then run the build with specific architecture:
```bash
npm run gulp compile && npm run gulp watch
```

3. In another terminal, run:
```bash
npm run electron
```

If you're still experiencing issues, it might be related to Node.js version or memory allocation. Try these additional steps:

1. Make sure you're using a compatible Node.js version (preferably Node.js 18.x or 20.x)
2. You might want to increase the memory limit by modifying the "gulp" script in <mcfile name="package.json" path="/Users/vashusingh/Documents/Coding/project/vscode/package.json"></mcfile>:

```json:/Users/vashusingh/Documents/Coding/project/vscode/package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    // ... existing scripts ...
    "gulp": "node --max-old-space-size=16384 ./node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js",
    // ... existing scripts ...
  }
}
```

This increases the memory limit to 16GB instead of 8GB, which might help with the build process on M1 Macs.

If you're still encountering issues, please share any error messages that appear during the build process.
